# 1. What is Emmet ?
- Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.

# 2. Difference between a library and a framework
- FRAMEWORK :- A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. It includes reusable pieces of code written to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality.

- A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly.

- Key Differences
Put simply, the “Inversion of Control” (IoC) describes the difference between a library and a framework. In some ways, you can think of a framework as a collection of libraries, but it’s entirely different. By using a library, you control the flow of the program. The library can be invoked whenever and wherever you like. Contrary to this, when you use a framework, the flow is controlled by the framework. The framework instructs you where to put your code, but it will call your code as required. Simply put, our code calls the library’s code, but in a framework, it’s the framework’s code that calls our code.
