# 1. What is Emmet ?
- Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.

# 2. Difference between a library and a framework
- FRAMEWORK :- A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. It includes reusable pieces of code written to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality.

- A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly.

- Key Differences
Put simply, the “Inversion of Control” (IoC) describes the difference between a library and a framework. In some ways, you can think of a framework as a collection of libraries, but it’s entirely different. By using a library, you control the flow of the program. The library can be invoked whenever and wherever you like. Contrary to this, when you use a framework, the flow is controlled by the framework. The framework instructs you where to put your code, but it will call your code as required. Simply put, our code calls the library’s code, but in a framework, it’s the framework’s code that calls our code.

# 3.What is CDN ? Why do we use it ?

- CDN stands for "Content Delivery Network." It is a network of servers distributed geographically across various data centers with the goal of delivering web content and other digital assets to users more efficiently and quickly. CDNs work by reducing the physical distance between the user requesting the content and the server providing it, thereby minimizing latency and improving the overall user experience

- Imagine you have a website with pictures, videos, and other stuff. When someone far away tries to see your site, it might take a long time to load because the stuff has to travel a big distance.

- A CDN is like having copies of your stuff in different places around the world, so when someone wants to see your site, they get the stuff from the closest place instead of the faraway one. This makes your website load faster and work better for people everywhere. It's like having little helpers all over the world who deliver your website stuff quickly.

The key advantages of using a CDN include:

- Faster Load Times: Content is served from servers that are strategically located to minimize latency and reduce the time it takes for content to reach the user.

- Scalability: CDNs can handle high levels of traffic and distribute the load across multiple servers, ensuring that websites and applications remain responsive even during traffic spikes.

- Reliability: CDNs often have redundancy built into their infrastructure, reducing the risk of downtime due to server failures.

- Global Reach: CDNs have servers in multiple locations around the world, enabling content to be delivered quickly to users regardless of their geographical location.

- Bandwidth Savings: CDNs can help offload traffic from the origin server, reducing the amount of bandwidth needed to serve content directly from the origin.

Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly, among others.

# 4. Why React is known as React ?

- The name "React" reflects the library's core principle of efficiently reacting to changes in data. When data changes in a React application, only the components that depend on that data are updated, and the rest of the interface remains unchanged. This approach is often referred to as "reactive programming," where the UI reacts dynamically to changes in the underlying data.

- React was developed by Facebook and was first released in 2013. It gained popularity quickly due to its efficient rendering approach, component-based architecture, and its ability to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Since then, React has become widely used in web development for creating single-page applications (SPAs), mobile apps using React Native, and even desktop applications with libraries like Electron.

- In summary, "React" is named so because it emphasizes the library's focus on reacting efficiently to changes in data, updating user interfaces in a responsive and dynamic manner.
